// Regular Expression (RegEx) is a part of coding which allows programmers to do many things. In Javascipt, RegEx :
// - Allows us to check a series of characters for 'matches'
// - Allows us to validate input fields e.g check for valid e-mail address, password and so on

// We write our RegExs in-between the '//' symbol

//Examples
// To look for a match

// e.g hello
/hello/
//Our RegEx code NOTE: this RegEx syntax looks for a match and not necesarilly an exact match in words.This  means that as long as hello is in the sentence or phrase it considers it a match.
